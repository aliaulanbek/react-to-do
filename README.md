# React Task Manager

I developed a simple web application using React.js to allow users to keep of their tasks throughout the day. This application features an intuitive interface with checkboxes for task status and dynamic updates.

Capablities:
- ➕ Add task using "ADD" button
- ✍️ Remove/Edit task by pressing trash and pen icons respectively
- 🗑️ Clear completed tasks by pressing button at the bottom of the list
